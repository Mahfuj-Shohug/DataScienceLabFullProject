                        macroeconomic factors and information on GDP is viewed as the significant file
                        for evaluating the public financial turn of events and for making a decision
                        about the working status of the macro economy in general. It is crucial to
                        Forecast microeconomic variables in the economic terminology. The main
                        macroeconomic factors to gauge are the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), swelling
                        and joblessness. As a total proportion of absolute financial creation for a
                        country, GDP is one of the essential markers used to gauge the nation's economy.
                        Since significant monetary and political choices depend on conjectures of these
                        macroeconomic factors, it is basic that they are just about as solid and exact
                        as could be expected. Erroneous figures might bring about destabilizing
                        strategies and a more unstable business cycle. GDP is quite possibly the main
                        pointers of public financial exercises for a nation."</p>

                        system growing up day by day. Therefore, some companies who provide these
                        delivery services usually called “Currier Service” are growing gradually. In this
                        paper, we choose the top delivery service company of Bangladesh and analyzed
                        customers’ sentiment based on reviews and comments which is collected from
                        their social media pages. We collected data of customers comments from the
                        “Sundorban Currier Services”, “Redx Currier Services” and “Pathao Delivery
                        System” official social media page are verified posts. In this sentiment review,
                        we have used Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Bangla to categorize those
                        reviews using multiple machine learning models. In those models, we have tried
                        to discover the number of negative and positive reviews or comments in real-
                        life social media platforms and predicted the reviews that are negative or
                        positive using the Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram methods.We have found that
                        the Bigram feature is the best for this analysis because it has the highest
                        accuracy of 90.72% and according to that the highest F1 score is 91.26. Using
                        the Bangla NLP approach, the machine learning models are categorized in
                        negative and positive reviews with the sentiment analysis method.</p>

                        There has no authority

                        blockchain was founded to relieve the problem of double-spending and also the interrupt in the

                        this technology is so strong that it can keep records permanently of transactions of business,
